segment nuclei (reconstruct from peaks)
segment cells (reconstruct from nuclei)
manually curate segmentation (weed out crap)
identify candidate spots (peak detection, keep only inside cells)
fit spots to 3D gaussian, compute intensity
classify spots with SVM
manually curate spots (weed out crap)
identify outliers with good bad data model? correlation with ideal spot?
